  <p>
    nvd3-tags is a library for building NVD3 charts without JavaScript, just
    from CSV data in the HTML.
  </p>

  <p>
    It doesn't expose the full power of NVD3 or D3, rather, it's a convenient
    tool for generating simple charts. It's especially convenient when using
    using a server-side web framework with a template engine, since you can just
    render the data into the HTML.
